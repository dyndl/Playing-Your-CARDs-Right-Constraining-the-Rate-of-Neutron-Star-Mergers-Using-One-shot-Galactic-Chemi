<div>The recent gravitational wave detection of a neutron star merger using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory has been used to help constrain the neutron star merger rate in the local universe. However, another way to constrain the rates is to access the $r$-process elemental abuHere we utilize an ensemble of chemical abundance ratio distribution (CARD) models of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to constrain the probable neutron star merger and supernova rates in UFDs. We find that the CARDs of different elements like, e.g., Barium and Magnesium, can be well approximated by assuming that the star formation histories in UFDs and progenitors of the very metal-poor Milky Way stellar halo are comprised of brief&nbsp; ('one-shot') events.</div><div></div>
