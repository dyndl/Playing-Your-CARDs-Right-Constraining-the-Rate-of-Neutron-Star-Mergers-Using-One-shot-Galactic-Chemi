<div>The recent gravitational wave detection of a neutron star merger using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory has been used to help constrain the neutron star merger rate in the local universe. Here I utilize an ensemble of chemical abundance ratio distribution (CARD) models of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to constrain the probable neutron star merger and supernova rates in UFDs. Assuming that the CARDs of different elements like, e.g., Barium and Magnesium, can be well approximated by abrupt s'one-shot'UFDs can I find that â€¦&nbsp;</div><div></div>
