<div>The recent gravitational wave detection of a neutron star merger using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory has been used to help constrain the neutron star merger rate in the local universe. We find that the CARDs of different elements like, e.g., Barium and Magnesium, can be well approximated by assuming that the star formation histories in UFDs and progenitors of the very metal-poor Milky Way stellar halo are comprised of brief&nbsp; ('one-shot') events.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
