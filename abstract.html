<div>The recent gravitational wave detection of a neutron star merger using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory has been used to help constrain the neutron star merger rate in the local universe. Here I utilize an ensemble of chemical abundance ratio distribution (CARD) 'one models of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to constrain the probable neutron star merger and supernova rates in UFDs. We demonstrate that the CARDs of different elements like, e.g., Barium and Magnesium, can be well approximated by the brief ('one-shot') star formation histories in UFDs and progenitors of the very metal-poor Milky&nbsp; can I find that â€¦&nbsp;</div><div></div>
