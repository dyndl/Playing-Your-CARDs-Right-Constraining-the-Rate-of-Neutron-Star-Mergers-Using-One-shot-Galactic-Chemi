<div>The recent gravitational wave detection of a neutron star merger using the LIGO and rare supernova (SN) events, exist. Here I utilize an ensemble of chemical abundance distribution (CARD) models of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to constrain the probable neutron star merger and supernova rates in UFDs. Assuming that … I find that …&nbsp;</div><div></div>
