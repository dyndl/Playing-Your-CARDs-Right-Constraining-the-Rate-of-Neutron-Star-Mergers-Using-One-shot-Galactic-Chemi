<div>The recent gravitational wave detection of a neutron star merger using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and immediate follow-up from various observatories capturing the aftermath of the event with observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to constrain the neutron star merger rate amonrare supernova (SN) events, exist. Here I utilize an ensemble of chemical abundance distribution (CARD) models of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to constrain the probable neutron star merger and supernova rates in UFDs. Assuming that … I find that …&nbsp;</div><div></div>
