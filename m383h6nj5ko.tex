The analysis and methods used in this paper follow and extend the methods used in \citet{Lee_2013}. In that paper, \citet{Lee_2013} proposed a novel approach to reproducing the CARDs we see in both MW halo and UFD stars. Instead of focusing 



The analysis treats the observed stars as a {\it fair} sample of stellar chemical abundances drawn from {\it parent} enriching stellar generations (ESGs). In \citet{Lee_2013} an ensemble of ESGs, $n_{ESG}$, of a given stellar mass, M$_{ESG}$
\footnote{Since the models do not invoke a truncated IMF, M$_{ESG}^0$ $\simeq$ M$_{ESG}^{draw}$ with $\sigma_{ESG}$ $\sim$ ???}, 
are stochastically sampled from a Salpeter IMF \citep{Salpeter_1955}. The total elemental mass yields of various elements tracked in the models are used to derive CARDs by converting the mass yields of each ESG realization in an ensemble of $n_{ESG} = 10^4$ to chemical abundances measurements. The distribution of chemical abundances in the ensemble constitute a {\it closed-box} statistical model representation of chemical enrichment in {\it one-shot} galaxies. 


In \citet{Lee_2013} these ESGs are defined by the CARDs by stochastically sampling stars from a Salpeter IMF \citep{Salpeter_1955} to    

Both sample of stars can
