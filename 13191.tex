\section{Introduction}
\label{intro} 
The recent detection and confirmation of a neutron star merger (NSM) using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and virgo?? (VIRGO) along with a host of other great ground and space-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum has led to a variety of new constraints on phenomena ranging from neutron star equations-of-state to the nature of the fabric of spacetime itself(?). In particular, the detection places new constraints on the NSM rates (R$_{NSM}$) found in the local universe. 

Constraining R$_{NSM}$ is important because of the role NSMs have along with supernovae (SN) in galactic chemical evolution and in the precise 'odd-even' elemental abundance patterns found in the Sun and in stars that are much more metal poor. The these patterns are directly related 

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:drag}
%	\int_a^bu\frac{d^2v}{dx^2}\,dx
%	=\left.u\frac{dv}{dx}\right|_a^b
%	-\int_a^b\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}\,dx.
%\end{equation}
