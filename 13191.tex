\section{Introduction}
\label{intro} 
The recent detection and confirmation of a neutron star merger using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and virgo?? (VIRGO) along with a host of other great ground and space-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum has led to a variety of new constraints on phenomena ranging from neutron star equations-of-state to the nature of the fabric of spacetime itself(?). In particular, the detection allow
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:drag}
	\int_a^bu\frac{d^2v}{dx^2}\,dx
	=\left.u\frac{dv}{dx}\right|_a^b
	-\int_a^b\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}\,dx.
\end{equation}
