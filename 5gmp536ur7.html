<div></div><div>The origin and nature of the r-process is still unclear although some prime astrophysical source candidates, like neutron star mergers and rare supernova (SN) events, exist. Here I utilize an ensemble of chemical abundance distribution (CARD) models of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to constrain the probable neutron star merger and supernova rates in UFDs. Assuming that … I find that …&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
